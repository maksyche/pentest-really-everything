# Pentest Really Everything

This is my new personal penetration testing cheetsheet. 

You can also check [the one](https://github.com/maksyche/pentest-everything) I created to get my OSCP certification.

In my notes, I often use some pre-compiled utilities that are stored in the private repo _(pentesting-tools)_. 
I cannot share them due to legal reasons, so you have to download/compile them yourself.
